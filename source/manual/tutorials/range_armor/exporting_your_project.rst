Range Armor require some files inside the new project folder you create, as your project file,
icons and some engine files from other releases if you want to export for more systems.

The folders is:
   - **Data** (Your Project)
   - **Engine** (Engine files)
   - **Icons** (Custom Icons)
   - **Launcher** (Range Armor Files)

Data Folder
-----------

First of all, move your project .rasec to the **Data** folder and delete the **Example Game.range**

.. figure:: /manual/tutorials/range_armor/img/dataproject.png

Engine Folder **(Optional)**
----------------------------

Now you need to move some files from the Range Engine release version to the **Engine** folder

In this example the project will be exported to Windows x64, so you need to copy some Range Engine
Windows x64 files to the **Engine/Windows64** folder

.. figure:: /manual/tutorials/range_armor/img/enginefiles.png

Icons Folder

In this folder you can set custom icons to your project executable file, you just got to replace
the stardard icons in the folder for your custom icons with the same name as the default icons
